# String. Condition: 
We need to have two Strings objects. The first object is created using "" (double quotes), the second is create using the constructor (new ....). Both have a value "String is a java class which cannot be extended. Why?". As first task you need to compare them and print on the console whether they are equal, they should be equal? Then you need to cut this piece  "Why?" from the first object and append to the beginning basically, swap from the end to the beginning. Print the first object to see the result. Then you need to make sure that second object starts with "String" word. If yes, print it if no print some kind of error. All manipulation with the text should be done by the String class methods.
